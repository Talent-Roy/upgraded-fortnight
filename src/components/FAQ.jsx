                Giftcard values and rates vary from time to time depending on
                several factors. So the giftcard that has the best rate at this
                moment might be different in the next hour.

                What Is The Difference Between E-code, Physical Cards And

                Physical gift cards are actual physical (plastic) cards that are
                purchased directly from a physical store. Physical gift cards
                are the safest and will fetch you the best money return. E-codes
                are digital gift card codes purchased online and mostly sent to
                the buyerâ€™s email address. Ecodes are not as safe as physical
                gift cards, thereby the money value is always lower.

                Giftcard transactions typically take a few minutes. However,
                some giftcards like Apple Store, Walmart, Nordstrom e.t.c can
                take more time than others. Average time will always be stated
                in trade terms but be rest assured we attend to all transactions
                as quick as possible.
